I am a Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Computer Sciences. My research centers on the intersection of **Security/Privacy** and **ML**. I work with [Prof. Somesh Jha](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/). I focus on systematically identifying security risks and advancing the theoretical foundations of robustness in LLM-integrated and other ML systems. By bridging theory and practice, my goal is to design principled defenses that safeguard machine learning applications against emerging threats, spanning the entire pipeline, from poisoning attacks during training to prompt injection attacks at inference.

I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, India in 2023. During my undergraduate, I had the privilege of spending a rewarding period of two years at the KISP Lab, National University of Singapore, collaborating with [Prof. Prateek Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/).
